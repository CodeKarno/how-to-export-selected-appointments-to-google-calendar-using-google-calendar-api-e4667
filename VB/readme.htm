<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to export selected appointments to Google Calendar using Google Calendar API</h1>
<p>This example illustrates how to export selected appointments to the specific Google Calendar defined by credentials that an end-user should enter before clicking the "Export..." button.

We have implemented a custom callback command (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument5462) for this purpose - ExportSelectedAppointmentsToGoogleCalendarCallbackCommand

In this custom callback command, we used the Google Calendar API for .NET (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v2/developers_guide_dotnet). Appointment entries in Google API are objects of the Google.GData.Calendar.EventEntry type. We created an instance of this object for each selected appointment and passed its primary members (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerAppointmentMembersTopicAll) to this instance. Note that statuses, labels, reminders, recurrence, resource associations are not exported to keep the clarity. The resulting entry is inserted into the Google Calendar via the Google.GData.Calendar.CalendarService instance.
